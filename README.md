# Numpy-and-Pandas-Assignment
# NumPy and Pandas Assignment – 3

This repository contains the solutions to the **NumPy and Pandas Assignment** provided in the Machine Learning course. The assignment is divided into two main parts:

- **Part I: NumPy**
- **Part II: Pandas**

The implementation and analysis are done in the Jupyter notebook:  
📁 `tanishka assighnment.ipynb`

## 🔢 Part I: NumPy Tasks

This section covers the basics and advanced usage of **NumPy** including:

- Creating 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays
- Array indexing and slicing
- Mathematical operations (element-wise, dot product, mean, median, etc.)
- Reshaping and transposing arrays
- Boolean masking and filtering
- Working with built-in NumPy functions (e.g., `linspace`, `identity`, `random`)
- Matrix operations and performance timing

---

## 🐼 Part II: Pandas Tasks

This section focuses on using **Pandas** for data analysis and manipulation:

- Creating and inspecting `Series` and `DataFrames`
- Filtering, selection, and conditional logic
- Handling missing data (filling, dropping)
- Grouping and aggregation by columns (e.g., gender)
- Reading from and writing to CSV files
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib on a real dataset

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

A public dataset was loaded and analyzed with the following steps:

- Summary statistics using `.describe()`
- Checking for missing values using `.isnull()`
- Visualizing distributions and correlations with:
  - `seaborn.pairplot()`
  - `seaborn.heatmap()`
  - `boxplot()` and more

---

## 💾 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

Install requirements using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
